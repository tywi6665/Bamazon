# Bamazon

### Overview:

The objective of this assignment was to build a node application to mimic Amazon. The app in questionm Bamazon, would allow users to choose from a list of products as well as, the number of that product they wanted. Since this app is linked to a mySQL database, the products and their respective quantites were generated, retrieved and updated through communication between node and mySQL. The second layer of this assignment was to create a manager facing application, This version allowed the manager to view the inventory, add stock to products and add completely new items.
